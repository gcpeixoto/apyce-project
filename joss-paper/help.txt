# Remarks on paper's compilation

# Steps that worked on macOS to have the paper compiled according to JOSS template:
# 1. Download TTFs for font Hack from here: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
# 2. Clone repo inara (https://github.com/openjournals/inara)
# 3. Update Makefile for ARTICLE path
# 4. Run make from inara
# 5. Get the outputs artifacts (.html, .crossref, .jats and .pdf)
# 6. Figure sizes were fit manually by compiling trials

# The command below crashed all the times with a "Killed" final message.
docker run --rm -it -v  $PWD:/data -u $(id -u):$(id -g) openjournals/inara -o pdf,crossref paper.md
